# PS4: Synthesizing a Plucked String Sound

## What is this assignment:
In this assignment we created a program that simulated a plucked string of a guitar. This
assignment was split into two parts. The first part was creating a circular buffer and testing it out
with a test file. In the second part the assignment was to build off the first and to make the actual
sound of a plucked string on a guitar.

## What was accomplished:
What I accomplished in this assignment was creating a program that simulated a plucked string
of a guitar. Each keystroke implemented makes a certain string sound. There are a total of 37
notes on the chromatic scale from 110Hz to 880hz.

## Key algorithms:
In this assignment in order to generate the audio there were two things needed. The first was
getting the values out of the StringSound object and then into the SFML audio playback object.
The second was playing the audio objects when a key press event occurred. What was also key in
this assignment was the Big O notation. This method is used to limit a behavior of a function
when used. This assignment also required us to implement three parallel arrays, which were
vectors. The first vector being of 37 sf::Int16, which holds the audio sample stream generated by
StringSound. The next vector of 37 sf::SoundBuffers, the object contained a vector of audio
samples. And the last vector of 37 sf::Sounds, contained each sound object where the sound
object can be played.

## Data Structures:
In this assignment queue data structure was implemented. Queue data structures use a system of
first in, first out. This method follows a particular order when operating. When in queue it will
be dequeued when finished.
